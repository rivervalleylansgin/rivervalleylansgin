Before applying for a disability loan, see if you qualify for emergency advance payment. The SSA offers advanced disability payments to qualified individuals based on the severity of their condition, the type and how likely they are to get approved for disability benefits. Also known as presumptive disability or blindness payments, they’re used to help fund the gap for up to six months between the application and approval in emergency situations. Unlike disability loans, they only need to be paid back in the case of overpayment and don’t have interest rates.

You will need to prove you are currently in an emergency situation to qualify, and the payments will be paid back through subtracting the amount of emergency advance you received from the amount you’re set to receive in disability.
